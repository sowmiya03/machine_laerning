1. Portal_for_researchers:-
Prototype to create web application for connecting researches with government funding schemes using web scrapping. I've also used Spark environment with AWS.

2. Text_summarization:-
We introduced a novel document-level encoder and proposed a general framework for extractive summarization. Experimental results across three datasets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results across the board under automatic and human-based evaluation protocols. 

3. IT_management_system:-
Designing database management system to maintain leave status of the employee.

4. Music_Generation:-
Given a dataset of Irish music,deploying a model using RNN to continue the music sequence.

5. Demand_forecast:-
Creating forecasting model to calculate demand on future from the transaction history in supermarket. I've used ARIMA time series model.

6. digits_recongnition:-
Using MNIST dataset I built model to detect numeric digits using CNN.

7. fish_prediction:-
Simple linear regression to find price of fish from given data.

8. house_price_prediction:-
Participated in kaggle competetion of predicting house price in Bostan. Implemented data cleaning and data visualization techniques.

9. hranalytics:-
Model to help HR select candidates based on previous data using Logistic regression.

10. solar_forecast:-
Given data on observation at weather station predict the future solar energy. This could help in solar energy farm. I've implemented this using time series model and RNN.
